# ELEC301_2018_FinalProject
I created a Google Colab notebook that would help students get started on the 2018 Rice ELEC 301 final project. Unfortunately, Github will not display the .ipynb notebook for some reason and so the link below should lead you straight to the Google Colab notebook. 

The final project task is to classify a movie poster as one of four classes: action and/or adventure, romance and/or comedy, drama and/or crime, and biography and/or documentary. 

The notebook provides sample code on how to download the movie poster data and preprocess the images. The code also helps students create a vanilla convolutional neural network using Keras and train the network using their data.
